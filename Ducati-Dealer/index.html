<div id="aboutText">
<h2>DNA Racing</h2>
The 959 Panigale Corse represents the highest sporting expression of the <br>
famous twin cylinder from Borgo Panigale. Thanks to the Öhlins suspensions,<br>
the lithium-ion battery and a dedicated livery inspired by the MotoGP <br>
colours, the 959 Panigale Corse is ready to hit the track.
<br>
<h2>Superbike Essence</h2>
<br>
<span id="text">
The track as a test bench, the stopwatch as an indisputable judge. For us <br>
victories and pole positions mean only one thing: the ability to build <br>
increasingly better street bikes. Because in Borgo Panigale competition <br>
and mass production are so close that they coexist. Technology, materials, <br>
innovative - and sometimes "visionary" - ideas give rise to unique <br>
motorcycles. Like the 959 Panigale, which incorporates the DNA and spirit <br>
of winning Superbikes to a practical level never seen before.

<br>
<h2>Why 959 Corse?</h2>
<br>
<span id="text">
The twin-cylinder Superquadro on the 959 Panigale is an integral part of <br>
the chassis as well as being the desmodromic heart of the bike. 157 hp <br>
at 10,500 rpm and a torque of 107.4 Nm at 9,000 rpm are numbers worthy <br>
of a Superbike, which on the 959 Panigale are managed not only by an <br> 
advanced chassis but also by a top-of-the-line technical package.<br>

<h2 id="3">Panigale V4</h2>
The Panigale V4 replaces the iconic 1299 at the top of the Ducati supersport <br>
range, doing so by enhancing performance and ridability so that riders of all<br> 
skill levels can enjoy boundless fun and excitement. The Panigale V4 has been <br>
developed in close collaboration with Ducati Corse, drawing directly on <br>
know-how and technology from the racing world to provide a road bike that is<br> 
the closest thing possible to its MotoGP counterpart.
<br>
<h2>Why V4?</h2>
<br>
<span id="text">
Elegant, muscular, technological. This is the essence of the style of the new <br> 
Panigale V4.The Ducati Style Centre gave shape to the character of the bike <br> 
and its performance following what for Ducati are the canons of Italian sports <br> 
elegance: large and soft surfaces interrupted by few bold marks. Component <br> 
integration, the idea of power and functionality have become dominant elements <br> 
of the style and of the whole project<br>
